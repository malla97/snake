Snake

This is a classic Snake-game I made to brush up my rusty Python skills and also learn about 
Pygame since I had no previous experience with it.

The game requires to have Python and Pygame installed. 
I used Python version 3.11.1 and Pygame version 1.9.6.

To run the game:
1. Download the snake.py-file.
2. Open terminal and go to the location the file was downloaded to.
3. Depending on your version type in terminal python3 snake.py or python snake.py.
